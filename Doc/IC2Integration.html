<h1>Power Units<br>
</h1><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: Currently only available for Minecraft 1.7.x.</span><br>
<br>
Stargate Power Units allow stargates to be run from the power systems of other mods instead of
requiring naquadah.<br>
<br>

The Power Unit should be installed below the stargate, under the base block or one of the bottom row of ring blocks.
It will take some time to charge up. Right-click to open a GUI showing
the current charge level.<br>

<br>

Energy stored in a Power Unit cannot be drained out. However, it
retains its charge when picked up, so you can move it from one place to
another without losing energy.<br>

<br>

Very long-range connections may require energy exceeding the maximum
capacity of a single power unit. To accommodate this, you can install
multiple power units under the gate. There is room for up to 5 units,
although you shouldn't need more than 3 under most conceivable
circumstances.<br>

This power unit is available when a mod providing RF power is installed, and

The recipe for this block depends on whether Thermal Expansion is
installed. If it is, the recipe uses items from Thermal Expansion;
otherwise, an alternative recipe using vanilla items is provided
instead.<br>
