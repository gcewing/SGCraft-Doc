A stargate is a transportation device developed by a long-vanished
alien civilisation known as the Ancients. Their vast network of
stargates was later taken over by the Goa'uld, a race of nasty sentient
parasites. The Goa'uld brought stargate technology to Earth, enslaved
the ancient Egyptians, and then largely lost interest in us. The only
traces remaining of them on Earth now are their influence on Egyptian
culture and a few pieces of mysterious technology.<br>

  <br>

How the stargate works is not known in detail,
but it appears to create a space-time wormhole linking it to another
stargate in a distant location. Once the wormhole is established, a
person can step into one stargate and be instantly transported to the
other.<br>

  <br>

A network of stargates is similar in some ways to a telephone network.
Each stargate has an address, and you establish a connection by
dialling the address of the stargate you want to connect to.<br>

  
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId334260"></a><a name="StargateComponents"></a>Stargate Components</h2>

Stargates are built from components that
may be found in various places in the world. You will sometimes find
stargate components in chests in dungeons and other structures, and
occasionally you may even come across a complete stargate. Some
components can also be crafted, but not all. In particular, the circuit
crystals that form the heart of certain key stargate components are
beyond our ability to replicate; these may only be found in the world
or purchased from a <a href="TokraVillager.html">Tok'ra villager</a>.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: Generation of stargates in
the
world is currently disabled by default due to incompatibility with some
other mods. You can enable it by setting the </span><span style="font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;">augmentStructures</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> configuration option to </span><span style="font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;">true</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><br>

  
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId205944"></a><a name="BuildingAStargate"></a>Building a Stargate</h2>

  <img style="width: 360px; height: 160px;" class="float-right" src="StargatePattern.png" alt="">To create a stargate, you need to
build a 5x5 ring composed of a
Stargate Base Block, eight Stargate Ring Blocks and seven Stargate
Chevron Blocks, arranged in the patter shown here. The blue circle on
the base block should face the direction you want the front of the
stargate to be in; the direction of the other blocks doesn't matter.<br>

  <br>

Once the last block is placed, the blocks of the ring will merge
together and form a Stargate.<br>

  
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId92294"></a><a name="StargateController"></a>Stargate Controller</h2>

To use your stargate, you will need a Stargate Controller, also known
as a DHD or Dial Home Device. The controller should be placed facing
the front of the stargate, within 5 blocks of the bottom centre of the
ring, either on the same level or one block above or below.If the
controller is properly linked to a stargate,
the central button will be orange. If it is grey, your controller is
too far from the stargate or facing the wrong way.<br>

  <br>

  <img style="width: 340px; height: 238px;" class="float-right" src="StargateAndController2.png" alt="">
Right-clicking on the <span style="font-style: italic;">top</span> of
the controller will bring up a GUI for entering a
stargate address. The address can be entered either by clicking buttons
on the circular
grid or typing letters on the keyboard. The Backspace or Delete key can
be used to erase characters. Once a complete address is entered, press
the Enter key or click on the orange button. If the address is valid,
the orange button will light up and the stargate will begin dialling
the address.<br>

  <br>

Once a stargate connection is made, it can be disconnected by pressing
the orange button again.<br>

  
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId450832"></a><a name="StargateAddressing"></a>Stargate Addressing</h2>

A stargate address is made up of either 7 or 9 characters, chosen from
an
alphabet of 36 symbols. For convenience, these symbols have been
mapped to letters and digits, so that you can write them down easily
and type them on
your keyboard.<br>

  <br>

To find out the address of a stargate, right-click somewhere on the
ring. The address displayed will look something like this:<br>

  <br>

  
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">QASQ-G6B-SA</span><br>
  </div>

  <br>

The hyphens are purely for readability &#8211; you do not need to enter them
when dialling the address.<br>

  <br>

The address encodes a dimension and a spatial location within that
dimension. The location has chunk-level resolution, meaning that you
can only have one useful stargate in each chunk (16x16 area). If you
dial the address of a chunk containing more than one stargate, one of
them will be connected to arbitrarily.<br>

  <br>

If you are connecting to a stargate in the same dimension, you only
need to enter the first 7 characters, for example,<br>

  <br>

  
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">QASQ-G6B</span><br>
  </div>

  <br>

To connect to a stargate in another dimension, you need to dial the
full 9-character address. You can only do this from a stargate that has
been expanded to 9 chevrons using a <a href="#ChevronUpgrade">Stargate
Chevron Upgrade</a>. The stargate at the other end must also have 9
chevrons, because it needs to dial back to complete the connection.<br>
<h3>Copying and pasting addresses</h3>
When you open a stargate's GUI, its address is copied to the clipboard,
so you can then easily paste it into a book or other place.<br>

  
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId74917"></a><a name="PowreringStargates"></a>Powering Stargates</h2>

  <img style="width: 48px; height: 48px;" class="float-right" src="NaquadahOre300.png" alt="">Before your stargate will do anything,
it needs to be supplied with energy. Stargates run on <span style="font-style: italic;">naquadah</span>, a
dense mineral of unknown composition that is a very rich energy source.
Naquadah is obtained from <span style="font-style: italic;">naquadah
ore</span>,
which is most commonly found underneath lava, although it occasionally
appears in other places. Due to its very high density, a
diamond pickaxe is required to mine naquadah.<br>

  <br>

The naquadah reactor that powers the stargate is located in the
DHD. Open the fuelling interface by right-clicking on the grey panel
near the bottom, and place naquadah in the fuel slots at the right. The
black rectangle is a fuel buffer that will be automatically refilled as
necessary from the fuel slots.<br>

  <br>

Establishing a connection requires a fairly large burst of energy,
and energy is also used as long as the connection remains open. Energy
usage varies with the distance between the stargates, and whether they
are in the same dimension or not. If you
don't keep the stargate open for longer than necessary, one
piece of naquadah is good for about 15-20 moderate-distance journeys to
a stargate in the same dimension. Travelling a very long distance, or
to another dimension, will use considerably more naquadah.<br>

  <br>

If you leave a gate open, it closes automatically after 5
minutes.<br>

  <br>

Fuel is only used by the stargate initiating the connection. No fuel is
required to receive a connection or maintain a received connection.<br>

  <br>

Alternative means of powering stargates are available if you have
certain other mods installed. See <a href="IC2Integration.html">Power
Units</a>.<br style="font-style: italic;">

  
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId759003"></a><a name="StargateMonitoring"></a>State Monitoring</h2>

The Stargate Base Block emits a redstone signal whenever the stargate
is active (dialling or connected).<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId983594"></a><a name="BaseCamouflage"></a>Base Camouflage</h2>
You can make the base of the stargate appear to be buried in the ground
by using the Base Camouflage slots of the stargate GUI. Placing a block
in one of these slots will cause the corresponding ring segment at the
bottom of the gate to be rendered using the texture of that block.<br>

Stargate Chevron Upgrade adds another two chevrons to a 7-chevron
stargate, enabling 9-character addresses to be dialled. To install the
upgrade, <span style="font-style: italic;">shift-right-click</span> on
the stargate while holding it. (If you just right-click, it will open
the GUI instead.)<br>

  <br>

Once the upgrade is installed, it cannot be removed except by breaking
the stargage base block, in which case the upgrade item will be
returned.<br>

Upgrade</h3>

  <img style="width: 48px; height: 48px;" class="float-right" src="IrisUpgrade300.png" alt="">A stargate inside your base can be a
fairly large security hole, since
there is nothing to stop an enemy from dialling in and invading you. To
guard against this, you can install an iris in your stargate by
shift-right-clicking on the base block with an Iris Upgrade item. <br>
<br>
To close the iris, apply a redstone signal to the stargate base block
or one of the blocks adjacent to it. When the iris is closed, any
players or mobs coming through the wormhole will be instantly killed,
and any items thrown through will be destroyed.<br>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId448298"></a><a name="SafetyPrecautions"></a>Safety Precautions</h2>

The opening transient of a stargate event horizon is extremely
dangerous. It is recommended to maintain a distance of at least 5
blocks from the front of the stargate until the event horizon
stabilises.<br>

  <br>

Breaking a stargate while a connection is open is not recommended. The
event horizon contains a large amount of potential energy; if the
stargate mechanism is disrupted, this energy will be explosively
released.<br>
