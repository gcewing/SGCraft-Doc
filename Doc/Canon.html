<h1>SG-1 Canon</h1>
In the interests of making stargates a practical transportation device
in Minecraft, not all details of SG-1 canon are strictly followed.
Configuration options are provided to change some of these if you want
a more authentic SG-1 experience.<br>
<h2>Travelling Direction</h2>
In SG-1, matter is only able to travel in one direction through a
stargate wormhole, from the initiating to the receiving gate. By
default, SG Craft stargates permit travel in either direction. This can
be changed using the <span style="font-family: monospace;">oneWayTravel</span> configuration option.<br>
<h2>Closing Connections</h2>
In SG-1, only the initiating stargate is able to close a wormhole. By
default, SG Craft allows a connection to be closed from either end.
This can be changed using the <span style="font-family: monospace;">closeFromEitherEnd</span> configuration option.<br>
<h2>Opening Time</h2>
In SG-1, a stargate is able to stay open for a maximum time of 39
minutes. Since a Minecraft day and night is only 20 minutes, some
scaling down seems to be called for. The default maximum opening time
in SG Craft is somewhat arbitrarily set to 5 minutes. This can be
changed using the <span style="font-family: monospace;">secondsToStayOpen</span> configuration option.<br>
<h2>Power Source</h2>
It's not entirely clear where SG-1 stargates get their power from, but
a naquadah-powered generator seems a likely candidate, since naquadah
is used as a power source for other technology in the series.
Furthermore, it seems likely that the generator is located in the DHD,
since Earth's stargate in SG-1 that was missing its DHD needed to be
powered in an ad-hoc manner.<br>
<h2>Number of Chevrons</h2>
Quite a number of people have pointed out that stargates are supposed
to have 9 chevrons, not 7. I hadn't noticed this before, because the
stargate in SG Command had two of them hidden behind the ramp, and
since they mostly only used 7-symbol addresses in the original series,
it never occurred to me that there might be more.<br>
<br>
It turns out that 7 chevrons is a much more convenient number for SG Craft,
because it fits evenly around a 5x5 ring with a gap at the bottom.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>The
current solution is to build a gate initially with 7 chevrons, and add
two more using an upgrade to allow 9-symbol addresses to be dialled.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><h2>Address Symbols</h2>As of SG Craft 0.8, address symbols are constellations, not hieroglyphs. Canon wins.<br>
<h2>Points of Origin</h2>
In SG-1, one of the symbols in each dialled address was supposedly a
"point of origin" indicating where the connection was coming from. SG
Craft does not incorporate this element, since it serves no purpose and
would only reduce the available addressing range.<br>
